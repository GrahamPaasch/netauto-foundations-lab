# Assessment and Evidence

Evidence is collected at the end of each day. Keep it in a local `evidence/` folder or a shared drive.

Logging and evidence
- Keep a run log with timestamp, command, targets, and result.
- Store logs under `evidence/logs/` (or `outputs/logs/` if you stay in lab folders).
- Reference log filenames in your daily recap.
